# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a machine-learning model for the classification of crop damage. This project aims to accurately classify the different types of damage in crops using various features, which can help in effective crop management and timely interventions to mitigate losses.

# Features
Model Training: Scripts for training the crop damage classification model.
Data Preprocessing: Utilities for cleaning and preparing data for training and testing.
Prediction: Code for predicting damage classification on new data samples.
Evaluation: Scripts for evaluating model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
